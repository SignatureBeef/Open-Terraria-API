# Open Terraria API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/OTAPI)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OTAPI/)

The Open Terraria API, known as OTAPI, is a unique low-level API for [Terraria](https://terraria.org) that exposes events and provides performance optimisations while supporting both client and server executables on all official platforms.

You can use this modification as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OTAPI/) to power your own project with minimal update downtime*, or you can build plugins for [Pryaxis's TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) which uses OTAPI under the hood.

<br/>

# Upcoming changes
This branch of OTAPI will be deprecated sometime in the future, and all work that depends on it should start considering the shift to [the new branch](https://github.com/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API/tree/upcoming) that will supersede it. This master branch will remain up until OTAPI3 is fully completed - you can [track the progress in projects](https://github.com/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API/projects). In the mean time the master branch may still receive Terraria updates, however it may not receive any further development or improvements. When OTAPI3 is completed the master branch will remain, but the upcoming branch will be renamed to default and it will then take the place of the default branch (instead of master).
